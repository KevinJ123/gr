# Go React
[GopherJS](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs) bindings for Facebook React. 

**NOTE: Very early and not usable ... yet.**

## Examples

There are some runnable examples in `/examples`. Just navigate to that folder and do a:

```bash
gopherjs serve
```

For help installing Gopherjs, please visit [that cool project](https://github.com/gopherjs/gopherjs).

## Inspiration

This project is highly inspired by [Vecty](https://github.com/gopherjs/vecty), a *promising and pure* Go React-like framework. If you're not heavily invested in Facebook's React, take that for a spin.
